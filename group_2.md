#### Prerequisites:
To participate in this experiment, you will need:
- Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2
- Computer, on which you are ready to install software to sideload applications on Quest
- Type-C cable to connect Quest to the computer
- Make sure that your VR headset is connected to the internet, otherwise it won't be possible to record your results

###  1. Download and install SideQuest tool (skip to the next step if you already have it installed)

To do that, please use instructions from SideQuest website: <https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto>
Please note that you will need to create an Oculus developer account to be able to sideload apps to Quest.

### 2. Connect your Quest to the computer using a USB Type-C cable. 
Do not forget to allow USB debugging in Quest.

### 3. Install the experimental application to your headset

Follow this link: <https://sidequestvr.com/app/4192/vr-navigation-experiment-variant-2>
Then press the button "INSTALL TO HEADSET" in the top right corner. It should automatically take you to the SideQuest app. If you are not redirected automatically, you can search for "VR Navigation Experiment - variant 2" directly in the SideQuest application. The app will begin downloading and then installing â€” you can check the progress in the downloads tab on the app's toolbar.

Once the install is finished, the progress bar will read "Success". Additionally, you will see an "All tasks completed!" pop-up at the bottom of your screen.

### 4. Launch the application on your headset and participate in the experiment!

In your Quests library, any sideloaded apps or games will appear in a different category called "Unknown Sources". 

On the newer Quest UI, there will be an "Unknown Sources" category in the librarys drop-down menu on the top right. You may need to scroll down to see this category. You can launch your sideloaded apps from there.

If you are using the original Quest UI, this will appear as a tab on the left-hand side of the library browser. 

#### Thank you for participation!
